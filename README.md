tools
=====

The project aims to create some tools that might be useful to a developer. Sooner or later one developer will find that 
his/her toolkit is missing something you desired badly. The products on the market are either proprietary or inaccessible 
somehow, which piss you way too much that you want to create the wheel yourself. :)
